I am a novice programmer with a passion for emerging technologies and a drive to develop innovative solutions. I am committed to learning and developing my skills as a programmer. I have been working with programming languages such as **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **HTML** to develop applications and websites. I am interested in creating mobile applications and working with the cloud to create secure storage services. I am committed to continue learning and developing my skills as a programmer.

I have been a programmer for **5 years** self-taught and only for small personal projects or for third parties, I handled various technologies over the years, because I need employment, I am currently studying to obtain certificates to validate my knowledge, such as:
 - Argentina Programa (UBA and UTN)
 - Catholic University of Salta
